# Web Vulnerabilities

Modern web applications are complex, and with complexity comes vulnerability. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a list of the top 10 most critical security risks to web applications. Here are a few of the most prominent.

## Injection (SQLi)
Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** An attacker alters a database query by manipulating user input. For example, submitting `' OR 1=1 --` into a login field might bypass authentication entirely.
- **Impact:** Attackers can view, modify, or delete database records, sometimes compromising the entire server.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is permanently stored on the target servers (e.g., in a comment forum). When a victim views the page, the script executes in their browser.
- **Reflected XSS:** The malicious script is reflected off a web application onto the victim's browser (usually via a crafted link).
- **Impact:** Attackers can hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

## Broken Authentication
Authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens.
- **Session Hijacking:** Stealing an active session cookie.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Using automated scripts to test lists of compromised credentials.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
- **How it works:** An attacker tricks the victim into clicking a link or loading an image that triggers a state-changing request (like transferring funds or changing an email address) on the vulnerable site.
- **Defense:** Using unpredictable Anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests.
