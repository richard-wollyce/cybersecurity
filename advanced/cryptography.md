# Cryptography

Cryptography is the mathematical foundation of data security. It provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption

### Symmetric Encryption
In symmetric encryption, the **same key** is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
- **Pros:** Very fast and efficient for large amounts of data.
- **Cons:** The key distribution problem. How do you securely share the key with the recipient?
- **Examples:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), ChaCha20.

### Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography)
Asymmetric encryption uses a **pair of keys**: a Public Key (which can be shared with anyone) and a Private Key (which must be kept secret). Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
- **Pros:** Solves the key distribution problem.
- **Cons:** Computationally expensive and slow.
- **Examples:** RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

*Note: Modern systems (like TLS) use asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a symmetric key, then use that symmetric key for the rest of the session.*

## Hashing
Hashing is a **one-way** mathematical function that takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size string of characters.
- You cannot reverse a hash to get the original data.
- A tiny change in the input produces a completely different hash (the avalanche effect).
- **Use cases:** Verifying file integrity, storing passwords securely.
- **Examples:** SHA-256, Argon2, bcrypt. (Never use MD5 or SHA-1).

## Digital Signatures
Digital signatures combine hashing and asymmetric encryption to provide authentication and integrity.
1. The sender hashes the document.
2. The sender encrypts the hash using their **Private Key**.
3. The recipient decrypts the hash using the sender's **Public Key** and compares it to their own hash of the document.
If they match, the recipient knows the sender actually sent it and that it hasn't been altered.
