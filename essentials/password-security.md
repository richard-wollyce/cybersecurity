# Password Security

Passwords are the keys to your digital life. If they are weak or reused, an attacker only needs to compromise one account to access everything.

## The Problem with Passwords
Humans are bad at creating unpredictable passwords and even worse at remembering them. We tend to use easily guessable patterns (like `Password123!` or `Spring2024`) or reuse the same strong password everywhere.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Passphrases instead of Passwords**
   - A passphrase is a sequence of random words (e.g., `horse-battery-staple-correct`). They are mathematically harder for computers to guess but easier for humans to remember.
2. **Never Reuse Passwords**
   - If a website gets hacked, attackers will try your email and password combination on banking, email, and social media sites. Every account needs a unique password.

## Password Managers

A password manager is a secure vault that generates, stores, and autofills your passwords.
- You only need to remember one strong "Master Password".
- The manager handles the rest, ensuring every site has a unique, 20+ character random password.
- Popular examples: Bitwarden, 1Password, Apple Keychain.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds a second layer of security. Even if an attacker steals your password, they cannot log in without the second factor.
- **Good**: SMS text message codes (better than nothing, but vulnerable to SIM swapping).
- **Better**: Authenticator Apps (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Duo) that generate time-based codes.
- **Best**: Hardware Security Keys (like YubiKey) which are physical devices you plug in or tap to your phone.

**Always enable MFA on your critical accounts:** Email, banking, and password managers.
